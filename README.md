## About
FoundIt is a mobile application designed to help Cornell students recover lost items and connect with their rightful owners. The app provides a platform for users to post lost or found items along with relevant details, enabling a seamless and efficient process for item recovery. <br>

# User Authentication
To ensure the security and exclusivity of the platform, FoundIt requires users to log in with their Cornell credentials. This authentication process restricts access to verified Cornell students only.

# Posting Lost and Found Items
Users can easily post details about lost or found items, including pictures and descriptions. The NetID of the person posting is associated with the item, allowing others to contact them directly.

# Personal Page
FoundIt provides users with a personal page where they can view their name, NetID, and a list of all their posts. This feature enhances user experience and helps keep track of their interactions within the app.

# Keyword Search
The app includes a powerful search functionality that enables users to search for specific items by entering keywords. This feature simplifies the process of finding relevant posts in the Lost and Found forums.

# Automatic Post Cleanup
To manage the database efficiently, posts that are a week old are automatically removed from the forums. Users receive a notification a day before their post is scheduled for removal, giving them the option to repost and keep the item in circulation.

# Tagging System
The app includes a tagging system that categorizes items into different tags such as "technology" or "clothing." Users can easily sort and filter posts based on these tags, improving the overall organization and user experience.
